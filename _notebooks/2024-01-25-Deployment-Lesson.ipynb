    "   - Verify Backend Docker files are running on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Domain Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Have a configured Domain Name pointing to the Public IP of your deployment server using AWS Route 53.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS EC2 Access\n",
    "1. **Login to AWS Console:**\n",
    "   - Access AWS Management Console.\n",
    "   - Navigate to \"EC2\" and select \"Instances.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Selection:**\n",
    "   - Choose the appropriate instance (CSP or CSA) based on your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Terminal Access:**\n",
    "   - Access the deployment server using either csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com or csa.nighthawkcodingsociety.com.\n",
    "   - Use the username \"ubuntu\" with the password hint \"3 Musketeers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Setup\n",
    "1. **Finding Port:**\n",
    "   - Run `docker ps` on AWS EC2 terminal to find an available port starting with 8â€”.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Identifies an available port for the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Docker Setup:**\n",
    "   - Configure Docker files in VSCode on localhost using the chosen port.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Sets up the local environment for Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing:**\n",
    "   - Run `docker-compose up` or `sudo docker-compose up` in VSCode terminal.\n",
    "   - Open `http://localhost:8---` in your browser to check if it runs smoothly.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Tests the application locally before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Setup\n",
    "1. **AWS EC2 Terminal:**\n",
    "   - Clone your backend repo: `git clone github.com/server/project.git my_unique_name`.\n",
    "   - Navigate to the repo: `cd my_unique_name`.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Sets up the server environment and fetches the project code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build and Test:**\n",
    "   - Build the site: `docker-compose up -d --build`.\n",
    "   - Test your site: `curl localhost:8---` (replace '8---' with your port).\n",
    "   - Explanation: Builds and tests the application on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS & NGINX Setup\n",
    "1. **Route 53 DNS:**\n",
    "   - Set up DNS subdomain for your backend server in AWS Route 53.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Configures DNS for domain mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NGINX Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-available` in the terminal.\n",
    "   - Create an NGINX config file and configure it accordingly.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Configures NGINX as a reverse proxy for the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation and Restart:**\n",
    "   - Validate with `sudo nginx -t`.\n",
    "   - Restart NGINX: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.\n",
    "   - Test your domain on your desktop browser (http://).\n",
    "   - Explanation: Validates NGINX configuration and restarts for changes to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Certbot Configuration\n",
    "1. **Run Certbot:**\n",
    "   - Execute `sudo certbot --nginx` and follow prompts.\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate options for HTTPS activation.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Configures SSL certificates for secure communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify HTTPS:**\n",
    "   - Test your domain in the browser using HTTPS.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Ensures successful HTTPS setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Code and Deployment Updates\n",
    "1. **VSCode Changes:**\n",
    "   - Before updating, run `git pull` to sync changes.\n",
    "   - Make code changes and test using Docker Desktop.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Synchronizes code changes and tests locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deployment Update:**\n",
    "   - If all goes well, sync changes via UI or `git push` from the terminal.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Deploys updated code to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling Changes into AWS EC2\n",
    "1. **AWS EC2 Terminal:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to your repo: `cd ~/my_unique_name`.\n",
    "   - Stop the server: `docker-compose down`.\n",
    "   - Pull changes: `git pull`.\n",
    "   - Rebuild and start the container: `docker-compose up -d --build`.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Pulls and updates code on the server, then restarts the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Troubleshooting Checks on AWS EC2\n",
    "1. **Check Server Status:**\n",
    "   - Use commands like `curl localhost:8---` and `docker-compose ps` for verification.\n",

    "   - Stores instance specific data\n",
    "      - ie: configuration files, logs, any data that is specific to that instance.\n",
    "   - This idea becomes vital when multiple instances are being used simutaneously. \n",
    "   - Having a seperate instance directory ensures that configurations and instance data don't get mixed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database\n",
    "1. **Purpose**\n",
    "   - Stores persistent data for the application.\n",
