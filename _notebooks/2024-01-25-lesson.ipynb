    "## Mini-Guide: Deploying Your Site with AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. **GitHub Repository:**\n",
    "   - Must have a backend repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docker Setup:**\n",
    "   - Verify Backend Docker files are running on localhost\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Domain Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Have a configured Domain Name pointing to the Public IP of your deployment server using AWS Route 53\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS EC2 Access\n",
    "1. **Login to AWS Console:**\n",
    "   - Access AWS Management Console\n",
    "   - Navigate to \"EC2\" and select \"Instances.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Selection:**\n",
    "   - Choose the appropriate instance (CSP or CSA) based on your project\n",
    "   - <img width=\"700\" src=\"https://github.com/The-GPT-Warriors/DeploymentLesson/assets/107821010/38f208bf-74d1-4d0f-b930-c3ddec75e4df\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Terminal Access:**\n",
    "   - Access the deployment server using either csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com or csa.nighthawkcodingsociety.com\n",
    "   - Enter the username and password\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Setup\n",
    "1. **Finding Port:**\n",
    "   - Run `docker ps` on AWS EC2 terminal to find an available port starting with 8â€”\n",
    "   - This allows you to identify an available port for the application\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docker Setup:**\n",
    "   - Configure Docker files in VSCode on localhost using the chosen port\n",
    "   - This sets up the local environment for Docker\n",
    "   - This will be shown later in the live demo\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing:**\n",
    "   - Test the application locally before deployment\n",
    "   - Run `docker-compose up` or `sudo docker-compose up` in VSCode terminal\n",
    "   - Open `http://localhost:8---` in your browser to check if it runs smoothly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Setup\n",
    "1. **AWS EC2 Terminal:**\n",
    "   - Setup the server environment and fetch the project code\n",
    "   - Clone your backend repo: `git clone github.com/server/project.git your_repo`\n",
    "   - Navigate to the repo: `cd your_repo`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build and Test:**\n",
    "   - Build and test the application on the server\n",
    "   - Build the site: `docker-compose up -d --build`\n",
    "   - Test your site: `curl localhost:8---` (replace '8---' with your port)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS & NGINX Setup\n",
    "1. **Route 53 DNS:**\n",
    "   - Configure DNS for domain mapping\n",
    "   - Set up DNS subdomain for your backend server in AWS Route 53\n",
    "   - Emaad will go over this in-depth later\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NGINX Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-available` in the terminal\n",
    "   - Create an NGINX config file and configure it accordingly\n",
    "   - Configure NGINX as a reverse proxy for the application\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation and Restart:**\n",
    "   - Validate with `sudo nginx -t`\n",
    "   - Restart NGINX: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`\n",
    "   - Test your domain on your desktop browser (http://)\n",
    "   - These commands allow you to validate your NGINX configuration and restarts for changes to take effect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Certbot Configuration\n",
    "1. **Run Certbot:**\n",
    "   - Configure SSL certificates for secure communication\n",
    "   - Execute `sudo certbot --nginx` and follow prompts\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate options for HTTPS activation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify HTTPS:**\n",
    "   - Test your domain in the browser using HTTPS, paste your link into the browser with HTTPS \n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Code and Deployment Updates\n",
    "1. **VSCode Changes:**\n",
    "   - Before updating, run `git pull` to sync changes\n",
    "   - Make code changes and test using Docker Desktop\n",
    "   - This will synchronize your code changes that you have tested locally\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deployment Update:**\n",
    "   - If all goes well, sync changes via UI or `git push` from the terminal\n",
    "   - This allows you to deploy updated code to the server\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling Changes into AWS EC2\n",
    "1. **AWS EC2 Terminal:**\n",
    "   - Pull and update code on the server, then restart the application\n",
    "   - Navigate to your repo: `cd ~/my_unique_name`\n",
    "   - Stop the server: `docker-compose down`\n",
    "   - Pull changes: `git pull`\n",
    "   - Rebuild and start the container: `docker-compose up -d --build`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Troubleshooting Checks on AWS EC2\n",
    "1. **Check Server Status:**\n",
    "   - Check the status of your website\n",
    "   - Use commands like `curl localhost:8---` and `docker-compose ps` for verification"

    "# DotEnv\n",
    "- DotEnv is the use of a .env file within a project to handle sensitive data, including API keys and database credentials.\n",
    "- The term \"dotenv\" is frequently associated with a specific library or tool that integrates these variables into the application's environment.\n",
    "- Its core objective is to refrain from putting confidential information, like access tokens, directly into the source code or version control. Instead, such details are put in the .env file, customized for each distinct environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DotEnv in relation to JWT\n",
    "- JWTs are digitally signed using either a secret (HMAC) or a public/private key pair (RSA or ECDSA) which safeguards them from being modified by the client or an attacker\n",
    "[jwt](/images/jwt.png)\n",
    "- Using a .env file, you can store your JWT secret key and keep sensitive information secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "1. Navigate to your project's root directory using the command line: example - \n",
    "```cd /home/aliyatang/vscode/aliyaBlog```\n",
    "2. Initialize a new package.json file for your project:\n",
    "```npm init -y```\n",
    "3. Install dotenv\n",
    "```npm install dotenv```\n",
    "4. Create .env file in root of project, in this file set JWT secret key: example - ```JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key```\n",
    "5. Make a .js file, require and configure dotenv so you can load variables from .env file into process.env: ```require('dotenv').config()```\n",
    "6. Whenever you need to sign or verify JWT, use the secret from the environment variables, keep key secure and easily configureable: ```const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Practices\n",
    "- Never commit `.env`, always keep `.env` in `.gitignore`, to prevent it being pushed to version control\n",
    "- Reguarly rotate secret keys for good security"
