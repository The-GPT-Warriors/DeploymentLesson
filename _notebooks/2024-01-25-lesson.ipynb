    "   - Verify Backend Docker files are running on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Domain Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Have a configured Domain Name pointing to the Public IP of your deployment server using AWS Route 53.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS EC2 Access\n",
    "1. **Login to AWS Console:**\n",
    "   - Access AWS Management Console.\n",
    "   - Navigate to \"EC2\" and select \"Instances.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Application Setup\n",
    "1. **Finding Port:**\n",
    "   - Run `docker ps` on AWS EC2 terminal to find an available port starting with 8â€”.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Identifies an available port for the application.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Configure Docker files in VSCode on localhost using the chosen port.\n",
    "   - Explanation: Sets up the local environment for Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing:**\n",
    "   - Run `docker-compose up` or `sudo docker-compose up` in VSCode terminal.\n",

    "# DotEnv\n",
    "- DotEnv is the use of a .env file within a project to handle sensitive data, including API keys and database credentials.\n",
    "- The term \"dotenv\" is frequently associated with a specific library or tool that integrates these variables into the application's environment.\n",
    "- Its core objective is to refrain from putting confidential information, like access tokens, directly into the source code or version control. Instead, such details are put in the .env file, customized for each distinct environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DotEnv in relation to JWT\n",
    "- JWTs are digitally signed using either a secret (HMAC) or a public/private key pair (RSA or ECDSA) which safeguards them from being modified by the client or an attacker\n",
    "[jwt](/images/jwt.png)\n",
    "- Using a .env file, you can store your JWT secret key and keep sensitive information secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "1. Navigate to your project's root directory using the command line: example - \n",
    "```cd /home/aliyatang/vscode/aliyaBlog```\n",
    "2. Initialize a new package.json file for your project:\n",
    "```npm init -y```\n",
    "3. Install dotenv\n",
    "```npm install dotenv```\n",
    "4. Create .env file in root of project, in this file set JWT secret key: example - ```JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key```\n",
    "5. In the beginning of your app file (like app.js or index.js), require and configure dotenv so you can load variables from .env file into process.env: ```require('dotenv').config()```\n",
    "6. Whenever you need to sign or verify JWT, use the secret from the environment variables, keep key secure and easily configureable: ```const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Practices\n",
    "- Never commit `.env`, always keep `.env` in `.gitignore`, to prevent it being pushed to version control\n",
    "- Reguarly rotate secret keys for good security"
